# No SchemaVersioning.plan surface

## Context

A version-management module often grows a "plan" function that inspects
the current version set and proposes the next steps. `SchemaVersioning`
was considered for one.

## Decision

`SchemaVersioning` ships no `plan` function.

## Alternatives rejected

**Add `SchemaVersioning.plan` to enumerate or sequence pending version
transitions.** Rejected because `catalogUrls` already sorts and dedupes
the version set for the catalog entry it assembles — a separate planning
surface would only restate, under a new name, a computation the existing
catalog derivation already performs. Shipping both would create two
places that could disagree about what the version set looks like.

## Consequences

Consumers needing a view of the version set reach for `catalogUrls` (via
`CatalogEntry.assemble`) rather than a dedicated planning API, keeping
the version-set computation in one place.
