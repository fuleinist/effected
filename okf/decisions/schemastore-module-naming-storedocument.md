# The assembly module is named StoreDocument, not SchemaDocument

## Context

`@effected/schemastore`'s central assembly module builds the
`$schema`/`$id`/`root`/`defs` document shape SchemaStore expects, and
needs a name that does not imply a broader mandate than the package
actually has.

## Decision

Name the module `StoreDocument`.

## Alternatives rejected

**`SchemaDocument`.** Rejected because it reads like the general-purpose
JSON Schema construction and manipulation the package's
[scope fence](../modules/schemastore.md#scope-fence) explicitly excludes.
A name naming "schema" as the noun invites exactly the scope creep the
fence exists to prevent — a reader encountering `SchemaDocument` would
reasonably expect it to build or transform arbitrary JSON Schema
documents, when the module in fact only assembles the specific
SchemaStore publication shape from a document core already generated.

## Consequences

The name itself now enforces the scope fence at the point a new
contributor first encounters the module: `StoreDocument` names the
SchemaStore-shaped artifact, not a general schema value, which makes it
harder to accidentally grow the module into the general JSON Schema
package the fence forbids.
