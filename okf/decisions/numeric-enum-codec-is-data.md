# The numeric-enum codec is data, not a typescript dependency

## Context

TypeScript's compiler options use string spellings in `tsconfig.json` (`"target": "es2023"`) but numeric enum values in its programmatic API (`ts.ScriptTarget.ES2023`). A consumer bridging between a decoded tsconfig document and a live TypeScript compiler API — a virtual-TS environment, for instance — needs a mapping between the two. The obvious way to get that mapping is to import `typescript` and read its enums directly.

## Decision

`@effected/tsconfig-json` owns the string↔numeric mappings for every TypeScript enum family as a **plain data module** (`TsEnumCodec.ts`), including the enum-value gaps that not all TypeScript versions export, transcribed by hand from TypeScript's own source rather than imported from the `typescript` package at runtime or at the type level.

## Alternatives rejected

**Importing `typescript` to read its enums directly** was rejected outright: it would violate the kit-wide zero-`typescript`-imports rule this package exists partly to enforce (see [no typescript imports](../conventions/no-typescript-imports.md)), and it would make the whole package's install cost jump by however large `typescript` itself is, for consumers who otherwise need nothing from it. **Depending on `typescript` as a type-only import** was also rejected — the hard rule is "zero `typescript` imports anywhere, including type imports," precisely so a structural or type-only dependency cannot quietly reappear as a build-time coupling to a specific TypeScript version.

## Consequences

Every enum family — `target`, `module`, `moduleResolution`, `jsx`, `newLine`, `moduleDetection`, and the rest — has its own hand-maintained table, verified against a specific installed TypeScript version at the time it was written (verification recorded as source comments citing the exact `typescript.js` line and version checked). When TypeScript adds a new enum member in a later release, updating this package is a **data edit and a test fixture**, never a dependency bump — the table's freshness is decoupled from whichever TypeScript version happens to be installed anywhere in a consumer's tree. The trade is that a table can lag a very recent TypeScript release until someone updates it by hand; the decode direction is deliberately passthrough-honest about this (an unmapped numeric value is left as-is rather than erroring), so a lagging table degrades gracefully rather than rejecting valid input outright. See [the enum mapping tables](../models/tsconfig-enum-mappings.md) for what an entry holds and how the table is refreshed.
