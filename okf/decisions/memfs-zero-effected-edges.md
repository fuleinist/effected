# memfs takes zero @effected/* edges, ever

## Context

`@effected/memfs` exists to be the filesystem test double every other
kit package devDepends on, `@effected/glob` included. Its `FileSystem.glob`
member needs glob-matching capability, which `@effected/glob` already
ships as a full-fidelity minimatch engine.

## Decision

`@effected/memfs` takes no `@effected/*` edge of any kind — not a
runtime dependency, not a peer, not even a devDependency.[^package-json]
Its `FileSystem.glob` member keeps the upstream vendored mini-glob
(brace expansion, character classes, globstar) rather than importing
`@effected/glob`, even though this duplicates matching capability the
kit already has elsewhere. The duplication is confined: the mini-glob
serves only `fs.glob`, never a public matching API of its own.

A new package was created for this role rather than folding the
capability into an existing one, because every existing candidate host
either inverts the law or is the wrong domain: `@effected/glob` would
have to be devDependency-consumed *by* its own test double, which is
circular; `walker`, `xdg` and `commands` are simply the wrong domain for
a filesystem engine; and `store` is both the wrong domain and integrated
tier, which would make every pure-tier consumer of the double take on an
integrated-tier dependency just to run its tests. A test-support leaf
package that everything may devDepend on and that itself depends on
nothing is the only shape without cycles.

## Alternatives rejected

**Import `@effected/glob` for `FileSystem.glob` and "deduplicate" the
matching logic.** Rejected because any edge from `memfs` back into the
kit creates exactly the cycle the zero-edges law exists to prevent:
`@effected/glob`'s own tests devDepend on `memfs`, so `memfs` depending
on `@effected/glob` at runtime would form a cycle through the dependency
graph the moment both packages are resolved together. The two-glob-engines
duplication this avoids is the deliberate price of keeping the graph
acyclic.

**Fold the memory filesystem into an existing package (`glob`, `walker`,
`xdg`, `commands`, or `store`).** Rejected for each candidate on
independent grounds: `glob` inverts the law (see above); `walker`, `xdg`
and `commands` are domain mismatches — none of them is where a
filesystem engine belongs conceptually; and `store` compounds a domain
mismatch with a tier mismatch, since `store` is integrated tier and
folding a pure-tier test double into it would force every pure-tier
consumer to accept an integrated-tier edge.

## Consequences

Every kit package, at any tier, can devDepend on `@effected/memfs`
without tier or cycle consequences, because the edge only ever runs one
direction — from a package's tests into `memfs`, never the reverse. The
cost is a small, self-contained duplication of glob-matching logic
inside `memfs`'s own internals, scoped to the one member that needs it
and never exposed as a public API a consumer could reach for instead of
`@effected/glob`.

[^package-json]: `packages/memfs/package.json` — `effect` as the only
    peer dependency; no `@effected/*` entry anywhere in the manifest.
