# The markdown canonical form is a published commitment — a row that moves is a breaking change

`Markdown.stringify` in the [markdown module](../modules/markdown.md) takes
no options, and its output is documented as stable on the TSDoc of
`Markdown.stringifyResult`[^stringify-tsdoc] and in the package README's
"The canonical form is stable" section[^readme-canonical]: a consumer is
told they may assert on these bytes, and that a pipeline needing stable
rendered markdown should serialize through here rather than through a
third-party stringifier whose defaults are free to move. The "documented
canonical form" suite asserts every row of that published table
byte-for-byte[^stringify-suite].

## The rule

- **Treat any change to a canonical choice as a breaking change**, never a
  patch, and bump accordingly. A row that moves silently breaks a promise
  consumers were invited to depend on.
- **Update the three copies together**: the table on
  `Markdown.stringifyResult`'s TSDoc, the README table, and the
  "documented canonical form" suite. A row present in one and absent from
  another is a drifted promise.
- **Never add a `stringify` option.** The configurable surface is
  `MarkdownFormat` + `MarkdownFormattingOptions`; the canonical stringifier
  is deliberately option-free so the corpora stay byte-stable. In
  particular the MDX `{` escape stays presence-keyed rather than becoming an
  option — see [the presence-keyed escape
  decision](../decisions/markdown-mdx-escape-presence-keyed.md).

## The two escapes the table itself states

Both were found by a consumer rather than by the package, and both are
documented on the same surfaces rather than left to be rediscovered:

- **Representability outranks a row.** The canonical form never emits text
  that would re-parse as something else, so a row yields where the two
  conflict. The case that reaches consumers is a language-less `Code` node
  directly after a list: indenting there is absorbed as list content, so it
  emits fenced in that position and indented everywhere else — a byte
  assertion over synthesized code blocks therefore depends on the
  preceding sibling. See
  [languageless-code-node-indents](../gotchas/languageless-code-node-indents.md).
- **`Mdast.fromMdast` strips fidelity fields**, being a spec-mdast admission
  boundary, so fidelity fields are settable only on the decoded tree; the
  drop is correct and silent, which is why both the boundary and the
  emitter document it.
