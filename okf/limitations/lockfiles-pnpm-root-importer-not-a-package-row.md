# The pnpm root importer is not represented as a package row

## Condition

A consumer parses a pnpm lockfile and wants a per-importer report of resolved dependencies that includes the workspace root importer (`.`) alongside every other workspace package.

## Symptom

The root importer's own resolution never appears as a row in `Lockfile`'s resolved packages — only non-root importers become workspace rows. A consumer iterating `lockfile.packages` (or the workspace-packages getter) to build a per-importer report will silently omit the root, with no error or indication that anything was skipped.

## Why this is acceptable

This is a direct, documented consequence of how the underlying model represents importers: only non-root importers are materialized as workspace package rows in `packages`, mirroring how pnpm itself treats the root importer differently in its own lockfile structure. Recording the gap here — rather than leaving a downstream consumer to discover it — is the point: a consumer designing a per-importer report needs to design around the root's absence from the start, not discover it as a bug after shipping.

## What the fix would take

Adding a synthesized root-importer row to `packages` would require deciding what identity and resolution data such a row would carry, since the root importer is not itself a resolved package instance the way other workspace packages are — it is the workspace's anchor point, not a dependency target other packages resolve against. No consumer has needed this yet; a consumer that does would motivate the design work to represent it correctly rather than as an ad hoc placeholder.
