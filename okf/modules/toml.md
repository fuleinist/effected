# toml

## Purpose

`@effected/toml` is TOML 1.1.0 as pure Effect schemas on a from-scratch, Effect-native engine: parse, stringify, Schema integration, a lossless CST, edit-in-place, a formatter and a visitor. It is a full-parity format sibling of [jsonc](jsonc.md), [yaml](yaml.md) and [markdown](markdown.md), sharing their surface contract — see [toml is a full-parity package built from scratch](../decisions/toml-full-parity-from-scratch.md) for why both halves of that sentence were deliberate. `smol-toml` appears only as a devDependency differential-test oracle, never as a runtime dependency.

## Tier and dependency posture

[Pure tier](../glossary/library-tier.md): `effect` is the only peer and there are **zero runtime dependencies**. No IO, no services, no layers, no `R` — all inputs are strings, all outputs are values, documents, edits, streams or typed errors. `smol-toml` is pinned exact as a devDependency only, imported solely by the oracle test file. `"sideEffects": false`.

## Architecture: linear CST plus semantic pass

TOML's syntax is flat — a linear sequence of key-value lines and `[table]` / `[[array-of-table]]` headers — while its semantics form a tree derived from those headers. The engine honors the split rather than papering over it:

- **scanner → recursive-descent parser → lossless linear CST**: a flat list of expression nodes whose spans **tile the source exactly**, each carrying attached trivia.
- **A separate semantic pass** walks that list to build the logical table tree, enforcing TOML's redefinition rules — table redefinition, dotted-key collision, appending to inline tables, array-of-tables interleaving — and emitting typed diagnostics with line, column and range.
- Value parse is CST → semantic pass → plain values; edit and format operate on the linear CST as text splices; the visitor streams events from the semantic walk.

The exact tiling is the round-trip proof: document stringify reconstructs the source by concatenating each expression's slice, so there is no separate re-serialization path to drift from the source. A tree-shaped CST like jsonc's was rejected: TOML's dotted keys, out-of-order headers and array-of-table headers scatter one logical node across non-contiguous source spans, so a tree CST would make edit and format fight the format. Two separate engines — a fast lossy value parser plus a CST layer — were rejected too, since there would be two grammars to keep in sync with no throughput requirement justifying it. Modification runs a **third** walk over the same expression list, purpose-built, because it needs a resolution tree with insertion points that the semantic pass's callback-only walk does not carry.

## Module layout

One concern per file, mirroring yaml's layout: a value facade (`Toml.ts`), the four datetime classes, the lossless document, the CST node classes, the edit vocabulary, format, visitor and diagnostics, with the engine under `src/internal/`. `src/index.ts` is the only barrel.

`noImportCycles` is error-level, held by one rule: `src/internal/` throws **raw carriers** — a raw error record and a guard-exceeded signal — and never imports a public module. The public modules catch those throws and materialize `TomlDiagnostic` (deriving `line`/`character` from `offset`) plus the tagged errors. The one sanctioned exception is that the engine may import the CST node classes and the four datetime value classes, because both are leaves that import only `effect` (and, for the nodes, the datetimes), so importing them from `internal/` cannot close a cycle back into the facade. Defect passthrough is proven, not assumed: every `catch` in the facade tests for the two raw carriers and rethrows anything else, so a genuine programmer-error defect is never silently swallowed into a typed error channel it does not belong in.

## TOML 1.1.0

The engine parses TOML 1.1.0, and there is **no version option** (see [Implementation notes](#implementation-notes)). The relaxations that matter when reading the grammar: `\e` (U+001B) and `\xHH` escapes, with `\xHH` deliberately bypassing the control-character ban the same way `\u`/`\U` already did; newlines and comments inside inline tables via a shared value-gap production, plus a trailing comma in inline tables; and optional seconds in times, with the secfrac group nested inside the seconds group per the ABNF, so `07:32` is valid and `07:32.5` is invalid (an absent seconds group materializes as `0`). Unicode bare keys are **not** in released 1.1 — they were dropped before release and are not implemented here.

**Liberal read, conservative write.** `stringify` keeps 1.0.0 spellings: seconds always emitted, no `\e` or `\xHH`, no trailing comma, single-line inline tables — every emitted document is therefore valid under both specs. The asymmetry is deliberate and safe in one direction only; do not "modernize" the emitter for symmetry. Document round-tripping preserves 1.1 spellings regardless, because it replays source text — only *value* stringify normalizes.

## Value model

Effect Schema classes throughout. **Datetimes** are four `Schema.Class` value objects, none subclassing JS `Date` — Effect's `DateTime` module has no local-only (offset-free, timezone-free) variant, and a `Date` subclass cannot faithfully carry a timezone-free value; they validate against the real Gregorian calendar, leap years included, and get structural equality for free. **Integers** split at `±(2^53 − 1)`: within that range a TOML integer decodes to a JS `number`, beyond it to a `bigint`, with both sides bounds-checked against TOML's 64-bit signed range on parse and on stringify. **Floats** are `number`, honoring TOML's `inf` and `nan` spellings; an integral float emits as an integer because JS cannot tag a `number` as float-typed once it holds an integral value, and an integral number past int64 range emits as a TOML float so the output re-parses — there is no representable fix without a wrapper type this package deliberately does not add, and every JS TOML emitter shares this limitation. The divergence from smol-toml's `Date`-subclass API is deliberate; consumers map at their own boundary rather than drop-in swapping.

## Hardening

Malformed input **always fails through the typed channel** — never a defect, never a hang. Arrays and inline tables are the only genuinely recursive value shapes, so a shared depth cap is enforced independently on both sides of the codec — parse descent and stringify descent — plus an explicit length check on the modification path's caller-supplied key path, so an attacker-controlled path array cannot force unbounded navigation. **Header and dotted-key nesting is deliberately not guarded, because it is not recursion**: table headers and dotted keys are parsed and navigated iteratively, so a header with thousands of segments resolves fine with no stack to blow — guarding it would defend against a cost that does not exist.

The remaining guards: prototype-pollution keys are neutralized (TOML keys are attacker-controlled, and `__proto__` would otherwise land as an own data property); control characters are rejected in strings and comments per spec, with escapes the deliberate carve-out; escape code points are validated against the surrogate range and the Unicode maximum; fractional seconds truncate beyond nanosecond precision rather than rounding or erroring. **U+FFFD is rejected** as evidence of a lossy upstream decode — corpus-compliant, but a deliberate deviance from the RFC 3629 letter that any Unicode scalar value is legal, costing a genuine U+FFFD scalar in string input. The semantic pass distinguishes two cases the redefinition rules can conflate: a header **passes through** dotted-created intermediate tables legally, while a header **landing** on a dotted-created table is illegal.

## Testing

`@effect/vitest`, `assert.*` — never `expect` — with tests in `__test__/`. Three families, none a substitute for another:

1. **The compliance gate**: the BurntSushi toml-test 1.1.0 corpus, vendored as committed plain files pinned to a recorded upstream ref, passing in full with **no skip list**. Byte-exact round-trip is proven over every valid corpus file; the corpus tree carries its own `.gitattributes` disabling text normalization, because several fixtures deliberately embed bare CR/CRLF bytes and must stay byte-identical to upstream.
2. **Differential property tests** against the exact-pinned `smol-toml` oracle, asserting parse agreement modulo the documented value-model divergence — the expected-divergence set is **empty**, and the assertion pins that. Should corpus and oracle ever disagree, the corpus wins (it is the spec's own compliance suite), and the divergence gets documented rather than silently resolved.
3. **Hand-written suites** for what the corpus cannot see: CST fidelity, edit/format/visitor behavior, the datetime classes, and a hostile-input suite exercising every guard above plus defect passthrough.

Corpus comparison is structural, not textual: expected datetime strings are re-parsed through the scanner's own classifier and compared with `Equal.equals`; integers are BigInt-compared. `smol-toml` never appears outside that one oracle test file and never in `dependencies`.

## Consumer seam

`TomlCodec` implements `config-file`'s `ConfigCodec` over this package's parse and stringify, living inside `@effected/config-file` as one of four free-standing codec exports, reached through a `workspace:^` peer. **Nothing in toml knows about config-file**: the edge points config-file → toml, and this package stays a pure, unaware format package.

## Implementation notes

- **Parse has no options class.** TOML parsing has no knobs, unlike jsonc's error-recovery mode or yaml's multi-document handling, so only the stringify direction carries an options surface. A spec-version knob was considered and rejected — it would fork the grammar, the corpus and every error-code union to serve no identified consumer. Do not add an options parameter speculatively.
- **The edit vocabulary is parity-identical** to its jsonc, yaml and markdown counterparts, and `applyAll` rejects overlapping edits as a defect like all four siblings do — a programmer-error guard on hand-constructed arrays, since format never produces overlapping edits itself. One behavior still diverges: `TomlFormat.format`'s range filter uses **owning-expression intersection**, where yaml's equivalent requires the edit to fall fully within the range — do not assume the two are interchangeable when porting range-filtering logic.
- **`Result` is the primitive.** `parseResult` and `stringifyResult` hold the engine; the `Effect` forms are `Effect.fromResult` over them behind their existing spans, so the two cannot drift. Never re-derive the engine on the `Effect` side — per the [sync primitive policy](../conventions/sync-primitive-policy.md).
- **`bind(Target)`** returns `{ schema, decode, encode }`, thin sugar over `schema(Target)` with **no new error taxonomy**; it lands identically in jsonc, yaml and toml, so the bound-codec shape joins the parity surface, with yaml's single-document restriction the sole cross-package asymmetry. Schema-producing, like `fromString` and `schema` — bind the result to a `const` on a hot path.
- **Recursive `Schema.suspend` references are typed `Schema.Codec<T>`.** `Schema.Schema<T>` leaves services `unknown` and breaks decode.
- **`TomlVisitor` construction is eager; only enumeration is streamed.** It parses, analyzes and sorts the full event list into document order before the stream produces anything; `Stream.take` still short-circuits consumption, but it cannot skip the up-front pass — do not advertise early termination as an input-size optimization for this visitor.

## Observability

Named `Effect.fn` spans on the public fallible boundaries only. No per-node instrumentation inside the scanner, parser or semantic pass. No metrics; telemetry-agnostic.

## Build

Scaffolded from a pure sibling with the api-extractor model wired at `website/lib/models/toml` in both `turbo.json` outputs and `savvy.build.ts`. The Schema class factories need the narrow `_base` suppression, one entry per class factory and no wider — this package carries the largest such count in the repository, tracking its larger class surface.
