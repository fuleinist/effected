# @effected/github-references

`@effected/github-references` is GitHub's issue-reference grammar as pure
functions: the nine closing keywords, a separate non-closing reference set,
and three dialects that read them. Strings in, values out — no service, no
layer, no client. `packages/github-references/src/` is three modules: the
two prose-and-line dialects (`IssueReferences.ts`), the list dialect with
its inline form (`ClosingList.ts`) and the keyword-family projection
(`KeywordFamily.ts`).

It is a package rather than a corner of [`@effected/github`](github.md)
because the grammar and the GitHub client have opposite dependency costs.
Pure-but-GitHub-shaped vendor rules belong in the kit rather than in a
consumer, but that rule says nothing about *which* kit package hosts them:
hosting the grammar beside the client cost `github`'s own consumers nothing
and cost an octokit-free consumer the whole client tree for a few lines of
pure string work — see
[the extraction decision](../decisions/github-references-extracted-for-install-weight.md).
The test before hosting the next pure vendor rule is not "does a client
already link here" but "can the consumers most likely to re-derive it
actually reach it".

## Tier and dependencies

**Pure tier**, per [the tier taxonomy](../glossary/library-tier.md). `effect`
is the only peer; zero regular dependencies, no services, no layers, no `R`
anywhere, `"sideEffects": false`. The inline and bare-line dialects are regex
and string work; everything in `ClosingList.ts` is a regex-free character
scan.

The dependency arrow points at this package: `@effected/github` takes it as
a regular `workspace:^` dependency, for one reason only — see
[the compat re-export](#the-github-compat-re-export).

## Naming

`@effected/github-references`, directory `packages/github-references`. The
short form `github-refs` was rejected on two counts: inside the GitHub
domain "refs" is already git-refs vocabulary (`refs/heads/...`), so the
short name would name the wrong thing, and house style is unabbreviated.

## The three dialects

One regex for all three is the tempting simplification, and it is wrong in
a way nobody would notice: accepting the colon inline would harvest
references GitHub will not link, so a pipeline would report an issue as
closing when merging the pull request actually leaves it open. The dialects
differ because their producers differ — prose is written by humans for
GitHub's scanner, a generated region is written by tooling for humans — and
that is the rule to apply if a fourth dialect appears.

- **Inline-in-prose** (`harvestIssueReferences`, `src/IssueReferences.ts`)
  scans running text — `"fixes #12 and closes #13"` — with mandatory
  whitespace and no colon, because that is the spelling GitHub's own
  scanner honours when it decides what a pull request closes. Each hit
  carries offsets; a digit run outside the safe-integer range is skipped
  rather than parsed, since rounding it silently yields a different,
  existing issue number.
- **Bare-line** (`parseBareLineReference`, `src/IssueReferences.ts`) takes
  the whole trimmed line as the reference — `"Closes: #12"` — with an
  optional colon, because a generated references region writes one
  reference per line and the colon reads better there. It deliberately
  carries no offsets: the line *is* the reference, so an offset would be a
  constant restated.
- **The closing-list dialect** (`src/ClosingList.ts`) reads one whole line
  naming several issues — `Closes #247, #248 and #251` — through two entry
  points over one engine: `parseClosingList(line)` answers a `ClosingList`
  (closing keywords only), and `parseReferenceList(line)` answers a
  `ReferenceList`, the superset that also accepts the non-closing
  `REFERENCE_KEYWORDS` (`ref`, `refs`, `references`), because GitHub's
  linker links `Refs #N` without closing it. `closing` is the
  discriminator, and `parseClosingList` is the closing-only view of the
  same engine rather than a second parser — a commitlint rule needs the
  strict closing view, a changesets harvester needs the categorized
  superset, and a consumer that fused the two would either link nothing for
  `Refs` or claim `Refs` closes something.

### Grammar

A whole-line dialect, the bare-line posture rather than the prose one —
after trimming, the entire line must be `<keyword>[:] <ref-list>`:

- Keyword is case-insensitive, and the result carries the canonical
  lowercase form.
- The colon is optional, as in bare-line.
- Whitespace is `[ \t]` only, so embedded newlines cannot smuggle a second
  line into a single parse.
- List items are `#<digits>`, separated by `,`, by `and`, or by the Oxford
  `, and`. At least one item is required, and `#` is mandatory.
- Trailing prose rejects the line — a whole-line dialect that ignored a
  tail would report a partial reading of a line it did not actually
  understand.
- Duplicates are preserved; deduplication is the caller's business.
- Any item whose digits exceed `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` rejects the whole
  line — the deliberate contrast with `harvestIssueReferences`, which
  skips an unsafe match in prose, because in prose the surrounding text is
  not a claim about the skipped number, while a list line's partial
  reading would misrepresent it as referencing fewer issues than it does.

The head pattern is derived from the two keyword constants rather than
spelled a second time, so a keyword added to either set cannot drift from
the grammar that reads it, and `closing` is membership in
`CLOSING_KEYWORDS`, tested once against a widened set so no call site
casts.

## Drift settlements

Downstream hand-rolled copies of this grammar disagreed with each other.
The kit is the place that settles the disagreement, and each settlement is
a ruling, not an average:

| Question | Settlement |
| --- | --- |
| Keyword set | The canonical nine GitHub documents; narrower downstream variants converge upward. |
| Bare `closes: 123` | Rejected — `#` is mandatory, since GitHub requires it for a same-repo closing reference. |
| The `Refs` category | A separate, non-closing keyword set, surfaced through `parseReferenceList` with `closing: false`. |
| ReDoS posture | A single left-to-right character scan — `ClosingList.ts` contains no regular expressions at all, so worst-case time is linear by construction and no input truncation is needed. |

One accepted behaviour delta, agreed downstream in advance: the kit's
`[ \t]+` separator is tighter than a `\s+` some downstream copies used — a
whole-line dialect whose separator class contains newlines is not really a
whole-line dialect. The inline harvester keeps that separator class
unchanged and admits the wider `\s` set in exactly one place, the
keyword-to-first-item gap, where the inline posture requires it.

## The companion surfaces

Four surfaces sit beside the dialects, all additive, none reopening a
ruling above and none part of the compat re-export:

- **`harvestReferenceLists(text)`** (`src/ClosingList.ts`) — the closing-list
  grammar worn inline (`Closes #123, Fixes #456` on one line), a gap
  neither original dialect covered on its own. Results are
  `HarvestedReferenceList` — a `ReferenceList` widened with `start`/`end`
  offsets. Word boundaries hold on both sides of the keyword; the
  keyword-to-first-item gap admits any whitespace including newlines, while
  list continuation keeps `[ \t]` only, so a list cannot cross a newline;
  an unsafe item anywhere skips the entire candidate rather than yielding a
  partial list; and the `and` separator stays lowercase-only in prose, so
  `closes #1 AND #2` harvests only `#1` — loosening it is a grammar change,
  not a local tweak.
- **`parseBareLines`, `parseClosingLists`, `parseReferenceLists`** — the
  per-line application every call site was writing as a `split("\n")` plus
  an `Option`-collect loop. No line numbers, deliberately: most consumers
  only aggregate the references, and a consumer that needs positions keeps
  its own split loop.
- **`keywordFamily(keyword)`** (`src/KeywordFamily.ts`) — the
  close/fix/resolve/ref projection consumers were spelling as
  `keyword.startsWith("fix")`, replaced by an explicit total `Record` keyed
  by every keyword, so a keyword added to either set without a family entry
  is a compile error rather than a silent miscategorization.
- **`collectReferenceLists(text)`** — the per-line composition of the
  whole-line and inline postures, for a text that mixes generated trailer
  lines with human prose. Per line, `parseReferenceList` is tried first —
  colon-tolerant, the line dialect's posture — and only a line that is not
  a whole-line list falls through to `harvestReferenceLists` on that same
  line. A line that matches whole-line never also gets harvested, so a
  colon-less trailer line, valid under both readings, contributes its list
  exactly once.

## Out of scope, recorded

- **Cross-repo and full-URL references.** Neither dialect's consumers emit
  them, and guessing their shape would freeze an API nobody has driven.
- **Issue-state classification.** Issue state is not grammar; a second
  consumer should drive it, and the first will likely want it from the
  client rather than from a parser.
- **A `@changesets/get-github-info` replacement.** That is API-tier work —
  it queries GitHub — so it belongs to `@effected/github` if anywhere,
  never to a pure grammar package.

## The github compat re-export

`@effected/github` re-exports exactly the six names the grammar was
extracted from it under — `CLOSING_KEYWORDS`, `ClosingKeyword`,
`IssueReference`, `harvestIssueReferences`, `BareLineReference`,
`parseBareLineReference` — so consumers that adopted the grammar in its
old home keep compiling. That re-export is the only reason `github` depends
on this package — see
[the compat re-export decision](../decisions/github-compat-re-export-droppable.md).
Two riders: it is droppable at a later `github` bump, once consumers import
from the new home, and the closing-list surfaces and the companion
surfaces above are deliberately not re-exported from `github`, so the
compat surface cannot widen by accident.

The promise is a test, not a comment:
`packages/github/__test__/IssueReferencesCompat.test.ts` exercises the
value exports through the entry point and annotates values with the type
exports, so compiling is the assertion for the types.

## Testing

`@effect/vitest`, `assert.*` — never `expect`; tests in `__test__/`, one
file per module. The suite carries the drift settlements as executable
rulings rather than as prose: keyword casing and canonicalization, the
optional colon, each separator form including the Oxford comma, mandatory
`#`, trailing-prose rejection, duplicate preservation and the whole-line
rejection on an unsafe digit run sitting beside `harvestIssueReferences`'s
skip-in-prose behavior for contrast. A hostility case pins the ReDoS
posture — a pathological long line parses in linear time and is neither
truncated nor hung on. The companion surfaces pin their own rules the same
way, including `keywordFamily` asserted exhaustively over every keyword
rather than sampled, and `collectReferenceLists`'s once-per-posture
preference, including a colon-less line proven to contribute once rather
than twice.
