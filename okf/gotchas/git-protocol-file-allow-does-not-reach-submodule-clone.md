# A repo-local protocol.file.allow does not reach a submodule add's internal clone

## What a reader sees

A test or fixture that adds a `file://` submodule fails with git's
transport refusal even though the superproject has `git config
protocol.file.allow always` set.

## What they would wrongly conclude

That the config key is misspelled, that `Git.submoduleAdd` strips the
setting, or that the package should pass an allow flag in its argv.

## What is actually true

git 2.38 and later (CVE-2022-39253) blocks `file://` submodule remotes by
default. A repo-local `protocol.file.allow` on the superproject does
**not** reach `git submodule add`'s internal clone subprocess (verified
against git 2.54); only a command-line `-c`, the environment
(`GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL=file`), or global config does. Whether to allow the
file transport is a caller-environment decision, not something `Git`'s
argv enables — nothing `@effected/git` spawns sets it, and it must not,
because the refusal is a security default.[^git-surface-int-test]

## The check

`GitSurface.int.test.ts` sets `process.env.GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL = "file"`
at module scope; `Git`'s per-call pins merge over `extendEnv: true`, so
the variable reaches every spawn in that file. The `forks` pool's
per-file process isolation keeps it from leaking into other suites. Copy
that shape for any fixture that needs a local submodule remote; do not
add a config write to the superproject expecting it to work.

    — the module-scope `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL` assignment and the comment
    recording the probe.
