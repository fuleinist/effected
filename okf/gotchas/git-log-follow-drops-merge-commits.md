# git log --follow is not the unfollowed walk plus more

## What a reader sees

A test asserting that `Git.log(cwd, { paths, follow: true })` returns
more entries than the same call without `follow` passes on one fixture
and fails on another, or passes without exercising the rename at all.

## What they would wrongly conclude

That `--follow` simply extends the walk across the rename, so "more
entries" is the property to pin.

## What is actually true

`--follow` linearizes history and **drops merge commits** (probed against
git 2.54), so the followed walk gains the pre-rename commits and loses the
merges. The two walks can be the same length and only their contents
discriminate; a length comparison is a test that cannot fail for the
right reason.[^git-surface-int-test]

This is why `log` has its own integration fixture. It is the only `Git`
member whose answer depends on the shape of history rather than one tree,
so its fixture carries a rename across the scoped path, an off-pathspec
commit and a real conflicted-then-resolved merge — what makes `--follow`
and `--diff-merges=first-parent` falsifiable at all. A mock spawner can
pin the parser; only real git can tell whether `--follow` walked the
rename.

## The check

Assert on the shas or paths a walk contains, never on how many entries it
has relative to another walk.
