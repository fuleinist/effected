 * strict-mode setup `AjvValidator` gates documents with, pointed at an
 * instance — which the `schemastore validate` command composes for you and
 * which that package also exports for a program that drives the contract
 * itself. Keeping the engine there keeps `ajv` out of every application
 * that imports this package at runtime.

 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { InstanceValidator } from "@effected/schemastore";
 * import { Effect } from "effect";
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const validator = yield* InstanceValidator;
 *   return yield* validator.validate({ type: "object" }, { any: "payload" });
 * });

 * // Provide the engine at the edge — the CLI does this for you:
 * //   Effect.provide(program, AjvInstanceValidator.layer)   (from @effected/schemastore-cli)
