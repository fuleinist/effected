/**
 * The shipped `SchemaValidator` implementation: ajv strict mode over the
 * Draft-07 meta-schema, with every declared `KeywordFamilies` keyword and
 * the standard `ajv-formats` vocabulary registered.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Lives in the CLI, not the library, so `ajv` is a cost only the command
 * pays: `@effected/schemastore` owns the `SchemaValidator` contract
 * and its doubles, an application that imports it at runtime never pulls an
 * engine, and the `schemastore` command composes this layer at its edge. It
 * is exported for a program that drives `SchemaPipeline` itself and wants
 * the same verdict the command gives.
 *
 * `validate` checks the document against the Draft-07 meta-schema and then
 * compiles it, reporting BOTH as `ValidationFinding` values: meta-schema
 * failures keep ajv's structured `instancePath` and `keyword`, while a
 * rejection ajv raises by *throwing* becomes a root-pathed finding — both a
 * strict-mode compile failure and a declared keyword whose NAME ajv's own
 * grammar (`/^[a-z_$][a-z0-9_$:-]*$/i`) refuses, such as an `x-ai-*` key
 * carrying a dot or a space. The error channel stays reserved for the engine
 * failing as a mechanism (`SchemaValidatorError`).
 *
 * The ajv setup is `internal/ajv.ts`'s `makeAjv`, shared with
 * `AjvInstanceValidator` so a document this gate admits always compiles in
 * the instance engine too — the two verdicts cannot drift.
 *
 * `strict` defaults to `true` — SchemaStore's gate. Each call builds its own
 * ajv instance, so documents sharing an `$id` never collide. Registering the
 * declared families keeps the engine's verdict consistent with
 * `DocumentLint`'s through the same predicate, so the two cannot drift; the
 * plugin's `formatMaximum` / `formatMinimum` limit keywords are deliberately
 * NOT registered, because the lint answers those as unknown keywords.
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { SchemaValidator } from "@effected/schemastore";
 * import { AjvValidator } from "@effected/schemastore-cli";
 * import { Effect } from "effect";
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const validator = yield* SchemaValidator;
 *   return yield* validator.validate({ type: "object" });
 * });
 *
 * Effect.runPromise(Effect.provide(program, AjvValidator.layer));
 * // => []
 * ```
 *
 * @public
